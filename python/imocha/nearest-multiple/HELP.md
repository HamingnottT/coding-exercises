# Mathematical Calculations: Nearest Multiple 

You are given a positive number N.

## Write a program to round N to the nearest multiple of 10.

## Note
Consider the smaller multiple if the number is equal from both sides.
For example:
1. N = 22, nearest multiple of 10 = 20
2. N = 38, nearest multiple of 10 = 40
3. N = 45, nearest multiple of 10 = 40 [consider the smaller multiple if the number is equal from both sides]

## Function Description
In the provided code snippet, implement the provided nearestMultiple(...) method using the variables to print the answer obtained after rounding N to the nearest multiple of 10. You can write your code in the space below the phrase “WRITE YOUR LOGIC HERE”. 

There will be multiple test cases running so the Input and Output should match exactly as provided.
The base output variable result is set to a default value of -404 which can be modified. Additionally, you can add or remove these output variables.
 
## Input Format
The input contains a single integer denoting N.
 
## Sample Input
34    -- denotes N

## Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000

## Output Format
The output contains a single integer denoting the answer obtained after rounding N to the nearest multiple of 10.
 
## Sample Output
30          

## Explanation
The nearest multiple of 10 to 34 is 30.
Hence, the output is 30.

## Sample Input 2
36    -- denotes N

## Sample Output
40         

## Explanation
The nearest multiple of 10 to 36 is 40.
Hence, the output is 40.
