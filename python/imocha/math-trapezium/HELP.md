# Mathematics: Trapezium

 
The above trapezium OPQR is divided into two trapeziums PSTO and QSTR.

You are given px, qx, and rx. 
Write a program to find a value of tx for which the area of both the trapeziums PSTO and QSTR is equal.

# Note
The formula is derived as tx = (px + qx + rx) / 4 
Calculate the output up to two decimal places. 
Example: 3.33, 4.24.

# Function Description
In the provided code snippet, implement the provided areaOfTrapezium(...) method using the variables to print the value of tx for which the area of both the trapeziums PSTO and QSTR is equal. You can write your code in the space below the phrase “WRITE YOUR LOGIC HERE”. 

There will be multiple test cases running so the Input and Output should match exactly as provided.
The base output variable result is set to a default value of -404 which can be modified. Additionally, you can add or remove these output variables.

# Input Format
The input contains three space-separated integers px, qx, rx.
 
# Sample Input
3 8 11     -- denotes px, qx, rx separated by a space
 
# Output Format
The output contains a single floating value with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point, representing the value of tx for the area of both the trapeziums PSTO and QSTR as equal.
 
# Sample Output
5.50
 
# Explanation
The formula is given as tx = (px + qx + rx) / 4
= (px + qx + rx) / 4
= (3 + 8 + 11) / 4
= 5.50
Hence, the output is: 5.50
