# TO-DO

# 1) memorize the first 10 squares
#   0^2 = 0
#   1^2 = 1
#   2^2 = 4
#   3^2 = 9
#   4^2 = 16
#   5^2 = 25
#   6^2 = 36
#   7^2 = 49
#   8^2 = 64
#   9^2 = 81
# 2) separate out their last digit into list
#   [0, 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1]
#   [0, 1, 4, 9, 6, 5] - w/o duplicates
# 3) Iterate through each digit of the number to square root
#   conditionals based on squares list
